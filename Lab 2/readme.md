## Lab 2 - Secret-Key Encryption
In this [lab](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Files/Crypto_Encryption/Crypto_Encryption.pdf), you will apply your knowledge of block cipher modes of operation to find out some interesting facts. You have to complete five tasks in this lab and submit a report describing your works and observations. The lab is one of the exercises in [SEED Project](https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Crypto/). It provides Virtual Machine (VM) image in order to simplify setups of experimental environment. We are using the Ubuntu 20.04 image for this lab. Load the VM image with your Virtualbox or VMware, and read the User Manual carefully before you start working on the tasks.

## Lab Notices
* You can skip **Tasks 1, 6.2, 6.3 and 7**– frequency analysis against monoalphabetic substitution cipher and programming using the crypto library. This will reduce some workload.
* You can use any bmp file you found for Task 3 as long as you can see the differences between it is ECB and CBC encrypted. Though [lena](https://github.com/Yu-Tsern/EN.650.658/blob/master/lab/lena_color.gif) is the standard testing image, it is not a good choice in this lab due to its complexity. Use some simple image that has large areas of same colors instead. The header of pictures encrypted by ECB and CBC should be the same.
* For Task 5, you should consider the decryption processes for ECB, CBC, CFB and OFB.
* Include screenshots, codes, IVs, keys you use in your report.
* Take screenshots periodically and include it in your report. They not only serve as evidences of completion but also help the grader understand what you're trying to achieve.

## Points Breakdown
This lab has 40 points in total. The five tasks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6.1) are worth 5, 10, 10, 10, 5 points respectively.

## Grading
* Completeness (30 pts): All the steps as instructed in the lab manual must be included in the report with adequate evidence.
* Presentation (10 pts): The report must be clear and correct in organization and writing with adequate explanation.
